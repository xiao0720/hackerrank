# HackerRank
My solutions to problems on HackerRank [(https://www.hackerrank.com/)](https://www.hackerrank.com/) using different languages (currently: Ruby).

To search for a domain, use `Domain Subdomain` in the top search field. For example: to find all the solutions in `Strings`, search for `Algorithms Strings`.

Current solutions:
* Algorithms
  * Warmup
  * Strings
